Resx2Xls is not done yet..

Features we would like soon
- Give clearer instructions on how to format the regular expressions (for excluded keys/comments)
- Give all columns in the produced excel file text wrapping
- Handle the case where multiple resources within the solution root have the same name
- Convert multiple solutions into 1 excel file
- Automatically mark bad translations (faulty string inserts, missing {0})

Long term
- Automatically add exported .resx files into solutions
- Automatically adjust japanese/chinese fonts in xna projects
- Read input .resx files from a solution file instead of recursively
- Migrate from winforms to WPF
 - check http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa972123%28v=vs.90%29.aspx for wizard sample
