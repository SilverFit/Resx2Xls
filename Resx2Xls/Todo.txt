Resx2Xls is not done yet..

Features we would like soon
- Convert multiple solutions into 1 excel file
- Scale images before inserting them (less bytes)
- Automatically mark bad translations (faulty string inserts, missing {0})
- Filter on default culture keys and comments using regular expressions

Long term
- Automatically add exported .resx files into solutions
- Automatically adjust japanese/chinese fonts in xna projects
- Read input .resx files from a solution file instead of recursively
